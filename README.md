A fully functional Notes application using Clean Architecture and MVVM pattern.

Implemented local data persistence with Room Database, allowing users to create, edit, and delete notes with both title and content.
Used Dagger-Hilt for dependency injection and Jetpack Compose for responsive UI.

We can choose a color for each note, and then order them by color, title or content.
